To list current policy and to avoid ad-hoc work-from-home days:
- Currently, the company has a policy of three days of work from the office and two days of work from home for all full-time employees. However, there are some 
  exceptions based on business needs. For example, colleagues who have face-to-face customer meetings or in-office presentations or preparation/ working sessions - will have to be in the office.

  all employees via email and other communication channels.
- Ad-hoc work-from-home days are not allowed other than in emergencies and any extenuating circumstances in which case the company has been and always will be 
  very supportive.
