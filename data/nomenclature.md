For casual, 8/12=0.67 per month and for annual 10/12=0.83 per month. Leaves only apply after probation and are applicable to full-time team members only. For annual leaves, two weeks prior notice should be given and all tasks should be discussed and planned with the team lead and project manager to ensure that the project timeline is not affected Two people working on the same project cannot take annual leaves simultaneously The calendar year for leave is from January to December. Each team member should send out an email for leave and log their leave on Easy Work. For causal leave approval, the team member shall notify the Team Lead ideally at least one day in advance.

Mental Health leave will not be carry forwarded and team members are allowed to maximum 2 leaves together.

Work From Home Team members may work from home if their job duties permit it. For example, people who are obliged to come in direct physical contact with customers may not be eligible to work from home. They may work from home full-day or half-day. However, work-from-home arrangements can be occasional/temporary and not permanent, unless authorized by the competent authority. To list current policy and to avoid ad-hoc work-from-home days: Currently, the company has a policy of three days of work from the office and two days of work from home for all full-time employees. However, there are some exceptions based on business needs. For example, colleagues who have face-to-face customer meetings or in-office presentations or preparation/ working sessions will have to be in the office. Please note that the company management reviews the work-from-home policy on monthly basis; therefore, it can change and a formal notification will be sent to all employees via email and other communication channels. Ad-hoc work-from-home days are not allowed other than in emergencies and any extenuating circumstances in which case the company has been and always will be very supportive. In case of an emergency or any valid reason for ad-hoc work-from-home, please ensure to inform all colleagues via the All Team WhatsApp Group before 9 a.m. that day. Once signed in, the team member shall inform on Teams General Group (Microsoft Teams). Similarly, when signing out the team member shall notify the same group. While working from home, colleagues are expected to respond to other colleagues (who are working from the office) within 30 minutes. If you are on a break, please message that you will revert. This rule applies to colleagues working in the office as well, i.e. when a colleague (who is working from home) contacts anyone in the office, the response time of 30 minutes must be practised.
